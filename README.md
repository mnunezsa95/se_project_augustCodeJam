### Intro

The 'Travellian' Website is a fictional website built on the idea of introducing a way for users to search for a city of their choice, and find tours that are geared towards learning about the history of a location. Many cities and towns across the world have a special and unqiue history and culture. However, there are not many booking sites out there that are geared towards the history component of a city or town.

### Contributers

This project was created by Ty Maraist, Reza Mohammadi, Marlon Nunez, and Christopher \_\_\_ as part of the TripleTen August 2023 Code Jam contest.

### TripleTen August Code Jam Challenge

The objective of the TripleTen August 2023 Code Jam was to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a digital service that a local, town or city community can benefit from.

### Description of Project

The fictional site was developed using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on responsive design. There are some functionality features added via JavaScript that allow you to click through different images on the page and submit their email to subscribe to the newsletter. Due to time constraints, the website is only focused on one location at the moment, which is Petra, to introduce the concept of the website. Please see the 'Plans for Improvment' section to gain a better understanding of future updates to the website.

### Figma Design and Images

The pre-made Figma design was used as a prototype for the website. The Figma design that the project was modeled after can be found using this link[https://www.figma.com/file/VnKwzxRJKcNHPcbx4wvrY2/Travellian---Travel-Agency-Landing-Page-(Community)?type=design&node-id=104-3957&mode=design&t=4rkLF4aSgZb2Lz1N-0].

### Plans for Improvement

As mentioned above, as of right now, the website is mostly built on HTML and CSS, with some functional features added by way of JavaScript. The team has agreed to continue working on the project after the August Code Jam submission to introduce further functionality to enhance user experience, such as the ability to search for new tours, and potential backend features that to enhance the website services.
