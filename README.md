### Intro

The 'Travellian' Website is a fictional platform conceived with the aim of providing users a unique way to search for a city and discover tours focused on delving into the history of a location. While many cities and towns worldwide boast special and distinct histories and cultures, there is a limited presence of booking sites that specifically cater to the historical aspects of a city or town.

### Contributers

This project was developed by Ty Maraist, Reza Mohammadi, Marlon Nunez, and Christopher as participants in the TripleTen August 2023 Code Jam contest.

### TripleTen August Code Jam Challenge

The goal of the TripleTen August 2023 Code Jam was to produce a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a digital service that could bring value to a local community, town, or city.

### Description of Project

The fictional site was crafted using HTML and CSS, with a primary focus on responsive design. JavaScript was employed to introduce certain functionality features, enabling users to navigate through different images on the page and submit their email to subscribe to the newsletter. Due to time constraints, the website currently concentrates on one location, Petra, serving as an introduction to the website's concept. For insights into future updates, please refer to the 'Plans for Improvement' section.

### Figma Design and Images

The pre-made Figma design served as a prototype for the website, and you can access the Figma design used for the project through this[link](<https://www.figma.com/file/VnKwzxRJKcNHPcbx4wvrY2/Travellian---Travel-Agency-Landing-Page-(Community)?type=design&node-id=104-3957&mode=design&t=4rkLF4aSgZb2Lz1N-0>).

### Plans for Improvement

As previously mentioned, the current state of the website predominantly relies on HTML and CSS, with additional functionality incorporated using JavaScript. The team has collectively decided to extend their efforts beyond the August Code Jam submission to implement additional features aimed at enhancing the user experience. This includes plans for integrating the capability to search for new tours and exploring potential backend features to further enhance the website's services.
